# Lexicon

A sleek vocab list with automatic dictionary defintions.

### Demo

See the [demo](https://vishusandy.github.io/lexicon/) hosted on github pages.

Feel free to make changes.  As it uses local storage you're the only one who will be able to see them.

## Notes

Everything is stored in local storage.  All changes are only saved locally on the device you are using.

A default list of vocab words is used for demonstration purposes.  Those words do not have dictionary definitions until you click the refresh button on them.  This is to reduce app size and API requests.

### Credits

Dictionary defitions and audio are queried using [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).
