# Lexicon

A sleek vocab list with automatic dictionary defintions.

## [Demo](https://vishusandy.github.io/lexicon/)

There is a demo on [github pages](https://vishusandy.github.io/lexicon/)

Everything is stored in local storage.  All changes are only saved locally on the device you are using.

A default list of vocab words is used for demonstration purposes.  Those words do not have dictionary definitions until you click the refresh button on them.

## Credits

Dictionary defitions and audio are queried using [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).
